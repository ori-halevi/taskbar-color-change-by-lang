# taskbar-color-change-by-lang
 This script toggles the ColorPrevalence setting in the Windows registry when a keyboard language change is detected, and refreshes the taskbar to apply the change and thus causes the color of the taskbar to change when the language changes.

**I want to emphasize that the idea for this software was brought to my attention by my dear friend [Meni](https://github.com/meni1221) who introduced me to [mati](https://github.com/matipojo) who built the code for [baafucha](https://github.com/matipojo/baafucha) (with a little bit of my help) and this idea is his.**


I highly recommend putting the software inside the following path so that it runs immediately upon restarting the computer:
"%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup".
